## Getting Started
If you are completely new to developing a PHP + HTML5 + Javascript + CSS website, you can get started with the W3C introduction over here:

[How to develop PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/)

[How to develop HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

[How to develop Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

[How to develop Css](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

Once you know what they are and how they works, you can now start working on ArOZ Online Modules.

To get yourself started, you can take a look at the "hello_world_demo" under ```demos/hello_world_demo/index.php```.
